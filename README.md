### Hello! I'm Jonathan. ðŸ‘‹


I work as a Crime Scene Investigator for my local Police Department. In my free time, I love to build. I have spent several years teaching myself the ins and outs of web development and have been loving every minute of it. I just recently graduated from a coding bootcamp (Nucamp) to help fill in some gaps as well as learn some new technologies. I still have a ton to learn and I am looking forward to all of the new projects that I will have the opportunity to be apart of.  



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my mobile application called E-Vidence (https://github.com/ewrjontan/e-videncemobile). It started out as a project for Nucamp and I am learning a ton as I build it. I am hoping to get a desktop version going soon.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning node.js and mongoDB. I have spent a lot of time on front-end technologies and it has been a wonderful change of pace focusing on back-end.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to build EVERYTHING. I loving building with wood as well as metal. Anything with a motor brings enjoyment to my life.
